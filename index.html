        <h2>What is mining?</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Mining is the process of adding transaction records to cryptocurrencies public ledger of past transactions. It is the process that keeps the cryptocurrency network alive.
          <br><br>
          Mining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found each day by miners remains steady. This so called “proof-of-work” concept is what gives legitimacy to the ledger contained in the network. This is why it’s done with either specialized hardware or GPUs - miners.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Where is the catch?</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Mining is also used to introduce currency into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a "subsidy" of newly created coins. This serves as motivating people to provide security for the system.
